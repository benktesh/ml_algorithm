    "Implementing NLP for troubleshooting\n",

    "# Goal \n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement an NLP-driven troubleshooting system that processes user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combine tokenization, POS tagging, NER, and sentiment analysis to extract relevant information from troubleshooting queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test the system with various troubleshooting scenarios and evaluate its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Set up the environment\n",
    "Setup environment by installing Natural Learning Toolkit (NLTK), Spacy and transformers for tokenization, NER and sentiment analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Tokenize user inputs\n",
    "Tokenize by breaking down text into individual words using NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Apply POS tagging\n",
    "Apply POS (Part of Speech) tagging. POS is the process of marking up words in a text with their corresponding part of speech based on both their definition and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Extract key entities with NER\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and extracts important entities from text such as:\n",
    "- **Product names** (e.g., iPhone, Windows, Chrome)\n",
    "- **Error codes** (e.g., Error 404, Code 500)\n",
    "- **Dates and times** (e.g., \"since yesterday\", \"2025-11-15\")\n",
    "- **Organizations** (e.g., Microsoft, Apple)\n",
    "- **Locations** (e.g., router, server, cloud)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Analyze sentiment\n",
    "Use the Transformers library to implement sentiment analysis to the user’s input to assess their emotional tone. Sentiment analysis can help detect frustration, satisfaction, or urgency, which might affect how the system responds to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Test the NLP-driven troubleshooting system\n",
    "Test the system for correctnes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Reflect and enhance\n",
    "Enhance the system by handling more complex user inputs or refining the sentiment analysis to detect subtler emotional cues.we can also experiment with enhancing the system by integrating other NLP components, such as text summarization or error message recognition."
